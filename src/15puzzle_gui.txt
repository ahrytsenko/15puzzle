1 Classes hierarchy

                        |<- Draught
Block <- VisualBlock <- |
                        |<- Draughts

1.1 class Block
Block is a very simple class. It represents some "abstract" (it means invisible) rectangle block.
It has a size (width and height) and a position (x and y coordinates).

Class Block can do in public:
- get/set its position in three different ways:
-- get/set X coordinate
-- get/set Y coordinate
-- get/set list of coordinates [x, y]
- get/set its size in three different ways:
-- get/set width (length by X coordinate)
-- get/set height (length by Y coordinate)
-- get/set width and height togather as a list
- get its top left coordanate as a list [x, y]
- get its top right coordanate as a list [x, y]
- get its bottom left coordanate as a list [x, y]
- get its bottom right coordanate as a list [x, y]
- get its coordanates as a list [TL_coord, TR_coord, BR_coord, BL_coord]

1.2 class VisualBlock
Class VisualBlock inherits from class Block and provides functionality to visualize a Block.
Class has extra private fields:
- color (block and border)
- width of its border

Access to these private fields can be provided by public methods:
- get/set color of block itself
- get/set color of its border
- get/set color as a list [blockColor, borderColor]
- get width of border: border is designed as a read-only field

Class can contains other instances of VisualBlock class and stores they in a list (items).
Method append is used to add items to the list.
Class can draw itself and all contained VisualBlock objects.
Class also can interact with user: method isSelected returns TRUE in case user clicks within object's rectangle, and FALSE otherwise.

1.3 class Draught
Class inherits from VisualBlock class and provide behaivor of one draught.
Draught has a text caption and a number ID. 
Class has a private field to store a pointer to the frame context. It is used for internal calculations in method getCaptionPosition.

Class has a set of getters and setters:
- get/set caption
- get/set number ID

In order to place caption at the center of draught class has a special method getCaptionPosition.
Method draw of the class extends inherited method of VisualBlock and add drawing a caption.

2 Game implementation (class Draughts)

2.1 Public part
Class Draughts inherits from VisualBlock class.
It acceps next parameters for constructor:
- size (inherit from VisualBlock; extended by third integer - the height of additional information panel under the main game field)
- color (inherit from VisualBlock)
- frame (pointer to the frame context)
- empty_number (tells to class which number will be tritted as an empty field)
- draughts_mtrx (a list of two integers: number of collumns and number of rows in which class will organize draughts)
- optional parameter: text label at the frame for displaying the best score

Three event handlers:
- onDraw - draw game field, draughts and information panel. Method is assigned in call frame.set_draw_handler()
- onMouseClick - implements behaivor for mouse events. Method is assigned in call frame.set_mouseclick_handler()
- onReset - implements restart of current game session. Method is assigned i call frame.add_button()

Public method updateBestScore() which displays the best score as a text label at the frame

2.2 Private part

2.2.1 Private fields
Class contains:
- string constants ("Game over", "Steps:", "The best score:")
- FifteenPuzzleCore class
- fields for values passed in constructor

2.2.2 Private methods
- getDraughtPosByID: accepts a number from 0 to (draughts amount -1) and returns a list [x, y] where specified drauhgt will be drawed
- getDraughtCaptionByNumber: accepts a number and returns ether string contains that number or an empty string if a number is equal to number identifies an empty place
-  getDraughtColorByNumber: accepts a number and returns ether color of the draught or inverted color for an empty place
-  getDraughtID: accepts row and collumn of a draught and returns its number. Used for pointing out a place in FifteenPuzzleCore object
-  updateDraughts: after move made will refresh draught's captions
-  getSelectedDraughtID: accepts a position where mouse clicked and returns an ID of draught where mouse click (or returns -1 if mouse click some where out of any draughts)
-  isOrdered: just a wrapper for FifteenPuzzleCore.isOrdered() method
-  isMovable: accepts a position where mouse clicked and returns true of false if selected draught is movable or not. It uses FifteenPuzzleCore.isMovable() method
- moveDraught: accepts a position where mouse clicked and uses FifteenPuzzleCore.moveDraught for make a move
- getBestScoreLabel: returns text for a text label (string constant plus the best score value)

2.3 Using a class for programming a game
2.3.1 Create a frame
2.3.2 Create an instance of Draughts class
2.3.3 Assign event handlers (onDraw, onMouseClick and onReset)
2.3.4 Update the best score text label (if if was created at the step 2.3.2)
2.3.5 Start a frame
