1 Classes hierarchy

                        |<- Draught
Block <- VisualBlock <- |
                        |<- Draughts

1.1 class Block
Block is a very simple class. It represents some "abstract" (it means invisible) rectangle block.
It has a size (width and height) and a position (x and y coordinates).

Class Block can do in public:
- get/set its position in three different ways:
-- get/set X coordinate
-- get/set Y coordinate
-- get/set list of coordinates [x, y]
- get/set its size in three different ways:
-- get/set width (length by X coordinate)
-- get/set height (length by Y coordinate)
-- get/set width and height togather as a list
- get its top left coordanate as a list [x, y]
- get its top right coordanate as a list [x, y]
- get its bottom left coordanate as a list [x, y]
- get its bottom right coordanate as a list [x, y]
- get its coordanates as a list [TL_coord, TR_coord, BR_coord, BL_coord]

1.2 class VisualBlock
Class VisualBlock inherits from class Block and provides functionality to visualize a Block.
Class has extra private fields:
- color (block and border)
- width of its border

Access to these private fields can be provided by public methods:
- get/set color of block itself
- get/set color of its border
- get/set color as a list [blockColor, borderColor]
- get width of border: border is designed as a read-only field

Class can contains other instances of VisualBlock class and stores they in a list (items).
Method append is used to add items to the list.
Class can draw itself and all contained VisualBlock objects.
Class also can interact with user: method isSelected returns TRUE in case user clicks within object's rectangle, and FALSE otherwise.

1.3 class Draught
Class inherits from VisualBlock class and provide behaivor of one draught.
Draught has a text caption and a number ID. 
Class has a private field to store a pointer to the frame context. It is used for internal calculations in method getCaptionPosition.

Class has a set of getters and setters:
- get/set caption
- get/set number ID

In order to place caption at the center of draught class has a special method getCaptionPosition.
Method draw of the class extends inherited method of VisualBlock and add drawing a caption.

2 Game implementation (class Draughts)

2.1 Public part
Class Draughts inherits from VisualBlock class.
It acceps next parameters for constructor:
- size (inherit from VisualBlock; extended by third integer - the height of additional information panel under the main game field)
- color (inherit from VisualBlock)
- frame (pointer to the frame context)
- empty_number (tells to class which number will be tritted as an empty field)
- draughts_mtrx (a list of two integers: number of collumns and number of rows in which class will organize draughts)

Three event handlers:
- onDraw - draw game field, draughts and information panel. Method is assigned in call frame.set_draw_handler()
- onMouseClick - implements behaivor for mouse events. Method is assigned in call frame.set_mouseclick_handler()
- onReset - implements restart of current game session. Method is assigned i call frame.add_button()

2.2 Private part

2.2.1 Private fields
Class contains:
- string constants ("Game over" and "Steps:")
- FifteenPuzzleCore class
- fields for values passed in constructor

2.2.2 Private methods
- getDraughtPosByID: accepts a number from 0 to (draughts amount -1) and returns a list [x, y] where specified drauhgt will be drawed
- getDraughtCaptionByNumber: accepts a number and returns ether string contains that number or an empty string if a number is equal to number identifies an empty place
-  getDraughtColorByNumber: accepts a number and returns ether color of the draught or inverted color for an empty place
-  getDraughtID: accepts row and collumn of a draught and returns its number. Used for pointing out a place in FifteenPuzzleCore object
-  updateDraughts: after move made will refresh draught's captions
-  getSelectedDraughtID: accepts a position where mouse clicked and returns an ID of draught where mouse click (or returns -1 if mouse click some where out of any draughts)
-  isOrdered: just a wrapper for FifteenPuzzleCore.isOrdered() method
-  isMovable: accepts a position where mouse clicked and returns true of false if selected draught is movable or not. It uses FifteenPuzzleCore.isMovable() method
- moveDraught: accepts a position where mouse clicked and uses FifteenPuzzleCore.moveDraught for make a move

2.3 Using a class for programming a game
2.3.1 Create a frame
2.3.2 Create an instance of Draughts class
2.3.3 Assign event handlers (onDraw, onMouseClick and onReset)
2.3.4 Start a frame
