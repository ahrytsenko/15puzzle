Section 1. Data structures
Name: lstPlaces (List of places)
Type: List (ordered)
Description: Contains 16 places for 15 Draughts (one place remains empty). 
Places have IDs from 0 to 15. In places we will store ID of draughts. 
Classicaly draughts numbered from 1 to 15. 
Here draughts will be internaly marked (have IDs) from 0 to 14.
During drawing draught's label we will add "1" to draught's ID.
Empty place will have ID 15. We will check this special number to draw an emply space instead of draught with label "16".
So desired state of a game will correspond to sorted list: 0, 1, 2, ..., 14, 15.
This state is equal to expression "Each place contains draught with ID that is equal to place's ID" (lstPlaces[i]==i).
Places are organized in four rows with four cells in each.
Row number is equal to [place ID / 4]: 0..3
Cell number is equal to [place ID % 4]: 0..3
Example 1: expression "lstPlaces[2] == 3" means "Draught with ID==3 (and with label=="4") now is laying at place with ID==2". Here row is 0 (2/4=0) and cell is 2 (2%4=2).
Example 2: expression "lstPlaces[10] == 15" means "Place with ID==10 is emply". Here row is 2 (10/4=2) and cell is 2 (10%4=2).

Name: lstMovableDraughts (List of places)
Type: List (ordered)
Description: Contains from 2 to 4 places from where is it possible to move draught to free place.

Name: iFreePlace
Type: integer
Description: ID of a free place

Name: iMovements
Type: integer
Description: Movements were made since the start solving the current puzzle 

Name: PUZZLE_SIZE
Type: constant (integer)
Description: Amount of rows (and colls cause its are equal). In classical game it is equal to 4

Name: IDX_MIN
Type: constant (integer, usually equals to 0)
Description: Minimal index of array

Name: IDX_MAX
Type: constant (integer, compute from PUZZLE_SIZE, usually equals to PUZZLE_SIZE-1)
Description: Maximal index of array
